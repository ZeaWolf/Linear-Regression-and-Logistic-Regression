"# Linear-Regression-and-Logistic-Regression" 

This project included "X.txt" and "Y.txt" contains data in text files.

There are a IPYNB File and a Python File, named LinearRegressionLogisticRegression. 
They both contain the same code. The code imported import numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, random, time libraries.

I would recommand open the IPYNB file using Jupyter NoteBook.

The CSE353_Assignment4_Report.pdf file is my report for this assignment.
